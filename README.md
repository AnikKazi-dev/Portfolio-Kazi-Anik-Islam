# Portfolio : Kazi Anik Islam

A fast, GitHub Pages friendly portfolio website (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) with animations, featured projects, and an auto-loaded “More Projects” section from GitHub.

## Run locally

Option 1 (recommended):

- Open a terminal in this folder and run: `python -m http.server 5173`
- Visit: `http://localhost:5173/`

Option 2:

- Double-click `index.html` (some browser features can behave differently without a local server).

## Structure

- `index.html` — page layout and sections
- `styles.css` — styling and animations
- `script.js` — interactivity + GitHub repo loading
- `Assets/` — images, screenshots, videos, resume PDF
