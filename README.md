# Portfolio — Kazi Anik Islam

A fast, GitHub Pages–friendly portfolio website (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS) with animations, featured projects, and an auto-loaded “More Projects” section from GitHub.

## Run locally

Option 1 (recommended):
- Open a terminal in this folder and run: `python -m http.server 5173`
- Visit: `http://localhost:5173/`

Option 2:
- Double-click `index.html` (some browser features can behave differently without a local server).

## GitHub Pages (publish)

1. Go to the repo: `Settings` → `Pages`
2. Source: **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: `main` and folder: `/ (root)`
4. Save and wait for GitHub to deploy

Your site URL will appear on the Pages settings screen.

## Structure

- `index.html` — page layout and sections
- `styles.css` — styling and animations
- `script.js` — interactivity + GitHub repo loading
- `Assets/` — images, screenshots, videos, resume PDF
